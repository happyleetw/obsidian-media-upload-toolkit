# üì∏ Obsidian Media Upload Toolkit

> Seamlessly upload and manage images and videos for your Obsidian notes across multiple cloud platforms

## üöÄ Overview

This plugin automatically uploads local images and videos embedded in your markdown files to your preferred remote storage service, then exports the markdown with updated media URLs to your clipboard. The original markdown files in your vault remain unchanged, preserving your local media references.

New in this version:
- Video Support: You can now upload videos (mp4, mov, avi, webm, mkv, etc.) in addition to images.
- Smart {path} Variable: Use {path} in your target path to automatically organize uploads by the top-level folder of your current note (e.g., /Diary/2025/06/ ‚Üí {path} = Diary).

### Supported Media Stores

- [Imgur](https://imgur.com) - Simple, free image hosting (images only, no video support)
- [AliYun OSS](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/object-storage-service) - Alibaba Cloud Object Storage

- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com) - Git-based storage
- [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/r2/) - S3-compatible storage

Perfect for publishing to static sites like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) or any platform that requires externally hosted media files.

## üîç Usage

1. Open command palette (Ctrl/Cmd + P)
2. Type "publish page" and select the command
3. All local images and videos will be uploaded to your configured remote storage
4. The markdown with updated media URLs will be copied to your clipboard with a notification

### Supported Media Formats

**Images**: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, SVG, WebP, Excalidraw
**Videos**: MP4, AVI, MOV, WMV, FLV, WebM, MKV, M4V, 3GP, OGV

### Path Variables

The plugin supports dynamic path variables for organizing your uploaded media:

- `{year}` - Current year (e.g., 2025)
- `{mon}` - Current month with leading zero (e.g., 06)
- `{day}` - Current day with leading zero (e.g., 15)
- `{random}` - Random string for unique naming
- `{filename}` - Original file name
- `{path}` - **Top-level folder name** of the current note

**Example**: If your note is located at `Diary/2025/06/my-note.md` and you use the path template `/{path}/{year}/{mon}/{day}/{filename}`, the uploaded file will be stored as `/Diary/2025/06/15/my-media.jpg`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

Each media store requires specific configuration in the plugin settings. Detailed setup guides are available in the [Appendix](#appendix) section below.

### Path Configuration

When configuring your storage service, you can use the **Target Path** setting to organize your uploaded media files. The plugin supports several variables that will be automatically replaced:

- **Basic Variables**: `{year}`, `{mon}`, `{day}`, `{filename}`, `{random}`
- **Smart Organization**: `{path}` - Automatically uses the top-level folder name of your current note

**Recommended Path Templates**:
- `/{path}/{year}/{mon}/{day}/{filename}` - Organize by note category, then by date
- `/{year}/{mon}/{day}/{path}/{filename}` - Organize by date, then by note category
- `/{path}/{filename}` - Simple organization by note category only

### Imgur Users: Obtaining your own Imgur Client ID

2. Visit¬†[https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient](https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient)¬†and generate¬†**Client ID**¬†for Obsidian with following settings:

   - provide any application name, i.e. "Obsidian"
   - choose "OAuth 2 authorization without a callback URL" (**important**)
   - Add your E-Mail

3. Copy the Client ID. (Note: You only need the **Client ID**. The Client secret is confidential information not required by this plugin. Keep it secure.)
4. Paste this Client ID in the plugin settings.
